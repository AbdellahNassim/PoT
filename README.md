Theoretical Framework for Proof-of-Trust Consensus Algorithm

1. Introduction

Proof-of-Trust (PoT) is a consensus mechanism where network participants stake their credibility instead of financial assets. Trust in PoT is dynamic—it decays over time without collaboration and is irreversibly lost upon fraudulent behavior. This framework refines the theoretical underpinnings of PoT, ensuring robustness, fairness, and resistance to attacks.

2. Trust Evolution Model

2.1 Initial Trust and Decay

Each node starts with maximal trust .

Trust decays exponentially if a node does not actively contribute:



where:

 is the trust decay rate.

 is the node’s contributions.

 is the maximum expected contribution.

2.2 Trust Recovery

Nodes can regain trust through consistent validation and contributions:



where  is the recovery factor.

Trust recovery is capped at  to prevent artificial inflation.

3. Attack Resistance

3.1 Sybil Attack Prevention

Unique identity verification ensures that multiple fraudulent nodes cannot be created.

New nodes must gain trust organically before participating in validation.

3.2 Collusion Resistance

Peers validate each other based on weighted historical interactions.

Majority consensus () required for a node’s validation.

3.3 Long-Range Attack Defense

Trust decay prevents dormant attackers from resurfacing after extended periods.

Trust cannot be restored once permanently revoked due to fraud.

4. Consensus Security Guarantees

4.1 Fairness and Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Trust-weighted validation ensures that nodes with a proven track record have a higher influence.

Fault tolerance is preserved as malicious nodes are gradually excluded from consensus.

4.2 Peer Validation Model

A transaction is validated if at least  of trusted peers approve.

Fraud reports trigger an investigation requiring  consensus for trust revocation.

5. Incentive Structures & Game Theory

5.1 Rewarding Contributions

More effort leads to higher trust and validation privileges.

Nodes contributing without immediate returns gain trust exponentially.

5.2 Penalties for Malicious Behavior

Fraudulent actions lead to an irreversible trust drop to zero.

A banned node can only re-enter the network through 51% peer approval, achieved through verifiable contributions.

5.3 Preventing Artificial Inflation

Contributions must be verifiable and peer-audited.

Automated systems may cross-check anomalies, but peer validation remains primary.

6. Conclusion

Proof-of-Trust offers a self-regulating, trust-driven consensus mechanism resistant to fraud, Sybil attacks, and collusion. Trust decays naturally, recovers based on merit, and is permanently lost in cases of malicious behavior. The model balances fairness, security, and sustainability, fostering an efficient and decentralized trust-based economy.
